# VS Code recommended extensions and settings

These files provide recommended extensions and workspace settings for VS Code for python development. The recommended extensions are:

* [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python"): Official python extension from Microsoft
* [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance): A performant, feature-rich language server for Python in VS Code
* [Python Type Hint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njqdev.vscode-python-typehint): Type hint completion for Python
* [autoDocstring](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring): Generates python docstrings automatically

If these extensions are not already globally installed, they will be recommended to you for installation when you open the project in VS Code.

Note: pylance now seems to be bundled with python extension, so may not need to be separately installed?
